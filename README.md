First Screening Test - Karishma Teckani

Welcome to my design submission for the First Screening Test. This repository contains the exported PNG files and supporting documentation for the design challenge. Below you will find the design process, tools used, and a link to the Figma file.



## üîß Tools Used

- **Design Tool:** [Figma](https://figma.com/)
- **Font:** Manrope (via Google Fonts)
- **Icons:** Heroicons, Iconscout (Open-source SVG icons)
- **Frame Size:** 1920x1080 pixels (Desktop), 430x932 pixels (Mobile)

## Design Approach

### 1. **Understanding the Requirements**
I thoroughly reviewed all three web sections provided and identified layout structure, spacing, typography, and color schemes. The main objective was to *accurately recreate* the layout as per the screenshots and assets provided while also creating a mobile-responsive version.

### 2. **Setting Up the Figma File**
- Created separate frames for each section: Desktop and Mobile.
- Defined base styles like font sizes, colors, shadows, paddings, and icon sizes for consistency.
- Ensured proper usage of layout grids to maintain alignment and spacing.

### 3. **Recreating the Layouts**
- Rebuilt the layout pixel-by-pixel based on the provided image references.
- Used open-source icons from Heroicons and matched them based on visual similarity (e.g., `DocumentTextIcon` for MOM Reports, `UserPlusIcon` for Invite Participants).
- Used consistent elevation and border-radius on feature cards.

### 4. **Mobile Adaptation**
- Converted horizontal layouts into vertical stack layouts for better readability on smaller screens.
- Adjusted paddings, margins, and font sizes for a clean mobile experience.
- Tested the layout on common mobile breakpoints (430px wide).

##  Creative Decisions

- **Icon Selection:** Since exact icons were not named, I visually matched icons from Heroicons that closely resemble the original designs.
- **Responsiveness:** Instead of compressing all elements, I restructured layouts for clarity, especially in stacked mobile views.
- **Typography:** Used Manrope as instructed and maintained hierarchy by setting distinct font sizes and weights.

##  Challenges Faced

- **Matching Icons Precisely:** Some icons in the reference were custom or styled differently than Heroicons, so I chose the closest match.
- **Color Accuracy:** I had to approximate some background and text colors from the image (due to slight compression or antialiasing).
- **Component Structure in Mobile:** Maintaining balance between visual appeal and information hierarchy on narrow screens took a few iterations.
